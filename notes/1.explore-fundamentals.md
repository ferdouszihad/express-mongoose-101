## 12-4 High Level Overview of Node.js Architecture

- Node.js is built on the V8 JavaScript engine, providing a runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server.
- It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, allowing it to handle many connections efficiently.
- The architecture consists of the Event Loop, Callback Queue, Thread Pool (via LibUV), and the V8 Engine.
- Incoming requests are handled asynchronously, with heavy tasks delegated to the thread pool.
- This design enables Node.js to serve multiple clients concurrently without creating a new thread for each connection.
- Node.js is ideal for I/O-heavy applications, such as APIs and real-time services, due to its scalable architecture.

## 12-5 Single threaded node.js

- Node.js uses a single-threaded event loop to handle all JavaScript code execution.
- All incoming requests are processed on the main thread, without creating new threads for each connection.
- Asynchronous callbacks and non-blocking I/O operations allow Node.js to manage many connections efficiently.
- Heavy or blocking tasks (like file system operations) are delegated to a background thread pool via LibUV.
- This model is highly scalable for I/O-bound applications but less suitable for CPU-intensive tasks, which can block the event loop.
- The single-threaded approach simplifies development and avoids common issues like thread synchronization.
- Node.js remains responsive by quickly delegating tasks and focusing the main thread on orchestrating events.

## 12-6 Creating Multiple Threads in JavaScript (Worker Threads)

- While Node.js is single-threaded by default, you can create multiple threads using the `worker_threads` module.
- Worker threads allow you to run JavaScript code in parallel, making it suitable for CPU-intensive tasks.
- Each worker runs in its own thread and communicates with the main thread via messages.
- Example usage:

  ```js
  const { Worker, isMainThread, parentPort } = require("worker_threads");

  if (isMainThread) {
    const worker = new Worker(__filename);
    worker.on("message", (msg) => console.log("From worker:", msg));
    worker.postMessage("Hello from main thread");
  } else {
    parentPort.on("message", (msg) => {
      parentPort.postMessage(`Received: ${msg}`);
    });
  }
  ```

- Use worker threads for parallel processing, but prefer asynchronous I/O for most Node.js tasks.
- Worker threads are available from Node.js v10.5.0 and above.

## 12-8 Modular system in node.js

- Node.js uses a modular system to organize code into reusable files called modules.
- Each file in Node.js is treated as a separate module.
- Modules help in separating concerns and improving code maintainability.
- You can export variables, functions, or objects from a module using `module.exports` or `exports`.
- Other files can import these exports using the `require()` function.
- Node.js has built-in core modules (like `fs`, `http`, `path`) that can be imported without installation.
- Third-party modules can be installed via npm and required in your project.
- Modularization enables code reuse, easier testing, and better project structure.
- Example of exporting and importing a module:

## 12-9 Explore Common JS Module

- CommonJS is the default module system in Node.js.
- Modules are loaded synchronously using the `require()` function.
- Each module has its own scope, preventing variable conflicts.
- You can export values from a module using `module.exports` or `exports`.
- To use exported values in another file, use `require('./moduleName')`.
- CommonJS modules are widely used in Node.js projects for code organization and reuse.
- Third-party packages installed via npm also use CommonJS by default.

## 12-10 Name Export , Aiasing

- Named exports allow you to export multiple variables, functions, or objects from a module with specific names.
- In CommonJS, you assign properties to `exports` or `module.exports` to create named exports.
- When importing, you access the exported properties by their names.
- Aliasing lets you import an exported value under a different name for clarity or to avoid naming conflicts.
- Example of named export and aliasing in CommonJS:

- Use named exports and aliasing to keep your code organized and readable, especially in larger projects.

## 12-11 IIFE as a Module wrapper

- In Node.js, each CommonJS module is wrapped in an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) by the runtime.
- This wrapper function provides module-level scope, preventing variables from leaking into the global scope.
- The wrapper exposes special variables like `exports`, `require`, `module`, `__filename`, and `__dirname` to each module.
- Example of how Node.js wraps a module:

  ```js
  (function (exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) {
    // Your module code here
  });
  ```

- This design ensures encapsulation and allows each module to manage its own dependencies and exports independently.
- Developers typically do not need to write this wrapper manually; Node.js handles it automatically.

## 12-12 ESM Module

- ESM (ECMAScript Modules) is the official standard module system for JavaScript, supported in Node.js from v12+.
- Modules are defined using `import` and `export` statements instead of `require()` and `module.exports`.
- ESM supports both named and default exports, allowing flexible import patterns.
- Files must use the `.mjs` extension or set `"type": "module"` in `package.json` to enable ESM in Node.js.
- ESM modules are loaded asynchronously, improving performance for large codebases.
- ESM provides strict mode by default and better static analysis for tools and bundlers.
- Example of ESM usage:

  ```js
  // math.mjs
  export function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  }
  export default function subtract(a, b) {
    return a - b;
  }

  // main.mjs
  import subtract, { add } from "./math.mjs";
  ```

- ESM is recommended for modern JavaScript projects and is interoperable with CommonJS in most scenarios.
